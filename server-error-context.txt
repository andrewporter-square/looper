Reviewer says: The cast `(e as object)` followed by null coalescing is problematic because `e` has type `unknown`. If `e` is not an object (e.g., a string or number), the spread operator will fail or produce unexpected results. Consider a safer approach like checking if `e` is an object before spreading: `{ error: e instanceof Error ? e.message : String(e) }` or use a type guard.
```suggestion
        const context =
          typeof e === 'object' && e !== null
            ? e
            : { error: e instanceof Error ? e.message : String(e) }

        capture.warning('Unexpected error during payment confirmation', context)
```

Action needed: Use a safer approach to handle the unknown type `e` by checking if it is an object before spreading.
